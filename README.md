# Professional-README-Generator-ch09
Professional README Generator is  a command-line application that dynamically generates a professional README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package

## Description
### Motivation to create this App was a wish to have a professional readme helper so that I can easy write README-files for my projects in a future.
### I built this App because it had a lot coding challanges neede to be solved. For me, as for a begginer, it was importent to get a new skills and got understanding that "I can do it!".
### This App hepls a developer to write a good-quality README-file. This App asks all necessary questions and in an order they should be answered so a developer will get a ready to use file at the end. This App saves time for developer to search on how README-file should look like. This App will keep the same style for all README-files. Using this App a developer should not worry about to forget anything.
### This project was interesting and usefull for me because, as a begginer, I learned how to use NodeJs, Inquirer package, Mardown syntax.
